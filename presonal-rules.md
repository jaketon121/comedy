# PERSONAL RULES

- Ask for permission to talk about someone in a bit.
- Make fun of the situation, not the victim (e.g. joke about racism, not race; jokes about confronting the concept of death, not jokes about specific people dying). There's a fine line that's difficult to define, but the most (uncomfortable) and best laughs come from walking this line.
- If people don't laugh after the tenth time you tell that joke, it's not funny.
- Curse for emphasis and cadence only.
- Make fun of the situation, not the victim. A bit shouldn't be funny because you're trying to be offensive. A bit should be funny regardless of how offensive it is. If it's not funny, it's not funny. Move on.
- Be careful getting into political territory. Don't take a side and lose half the room. If you do take a side, make sure it's not in a way that attacks the supporters of one policy/party/politician. These bits also have an expiration date; they lose their relevance. You should be more creative and write more material to make up for the lack of political commentary.
- Pretending to be prepared with something clever and then not saying something clever isnâ€™t clever. Talking about how you didn't finish writing a bit at an open mic is a waste of your and the audience's time.
- Don't do impressions or rely on stereotypes. There are other, more genuine ways to get the audience to relate to you.
- Don't fuel outrage. In fact, this doesn't make anyone laugh, it just makes people angry. It doesn't matter if people agree or disagree with your view, it matters if you approach the subject in a way that's funny.
- Crowd work is good for changing the energy in the room to improve the overall delivery of your set, segue into another bit, and to check in with the audience. It is not the focus of your set.
