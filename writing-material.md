# WRITING MATERIAL

## Rules

These are general rules for writing material based on notes I take during and after open mics, mostly from watching other comics. I learn a lot more from watching people bomb than I do from watching professionals on Netflix and YouTube, and of course, as I gain experience, the list becomes more refined. The rules are kept general so that any examples that might pop into my head while I review my own notes are more obviously relevant.

### Etiquette

- Don't steal jokes.
- When in doubt, appeal to a broader audience.

### Constraints

- Anytime you impose a constraint on your comedy, it becomes difficult. Constrainting yourself to only clean comedy, feminist comedy, offensive comedy -- it's all hard. Don't be afraid to branch out when you first start.
- You may consider some jokes to get cheap laughs, but as you gain more experience, you'll start to learn what you like, what audiences like, and what's contained in the intersection of those sets. Once you get good at that, you can start constraining yourself to whatever material you want for whatever reason.

### Motivation

- A lot of comedians get on stage and rant without making a joke and acting surprised that the audience isn't amused. It's better if anger doesn't inform your comedy. Approach the same topic from a different angle. Focus on other bits and go back to this one later when you're calm and when you have more ideas and material to connect.
- The bits that require the least amount of work come from a genuine desire to connect with an audience.

### Styles(s)

- Don't complain so much.
- Avoid self deprecating humor.
- Instead of criticizing people or putting them down, call people out on their shit.
- When you describe something terrible, describe it in a way that ignores a big chunk of the problem and focuses on the positives in some surreal or absurd way
- View things from the other side and twist the logic so that it makes sense on some level. The plan is to get the audience to follow the logic to some conclusion that's in direct conflict with their basic assumptions/beliefs/feelings. Just make sure you agree with the audience, otherwise, the joke will come off as preachy.
- You can either distract from the pain or confront the pain. Some audiences don't want to confront the pain. If you choose one style, write some jokes in the other style to fall back on.

## Construction

### Challenge Inherent Assumptions About Each Sentence You Write

- Think about the assumptions the audience might make and break them down (see below).
  - Implied knowledge
  - Alternate word meanings
  - Alternate contexts
- Build a story around the assumptions you violated (absurd humor)
- Link the story to the original bit/reality

### Complete Bits

- Always include examples/stories/analogies for more build up.
- Place the events of the story in a different order. Think about when the audience is exposed to different parts of the story and how you want the audience to react. This will help guide the delivery of the bit.

### Putting Together a Set

- If you have controversial or sensitive bits, build up to them. The audience isn't conscious of the fact that you're technically playing a character. If your set has a theme and that theme becomes darker or dirtier, plan to let that happen over time. Keep the audience on your side. They can hate the character you play, put that distinction is a subconscious one.

## Proofreading Bits

- Ask yourself if the audience can relate and connect.
- Connect your bits so that you can reference them later in a set.
- Separate the bits that work in different situations (college bits, political bits, situational bits) from universally relevant/relatable bits.
- Add context at the beginning of a bit to get the audience to relate. Rearrange the bit so that it doesn’t come off as explaining the bit to the audience. Write the bit backwards and think about how it would come across.
- Imagery and hyperbole aren’t good on their own, you have to involve plot twists and similes and metaphors (you might be able to do this on the fly after a few years).
