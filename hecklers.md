# HECKLERS

## Examine Venue

- There's something about each room where there are specific seats that attract certain types of people. There's a spot for the most drunk person in the room, there's a spot for the stupidest person in the room, there's a place for everyone. It's not the same person every night, but it's the same seat.
- These personalities tend to talk during a show. Watch these people and work the crowd in a way that makes the rest of the crowd respond more and keep attention off these specific personalities.
- If you do crowd work, keep the focus on the other side of the room from potential hecklers.

## Conduct

I have yet to be heckled. These are some tips I wrote down by watching YouTube videos.

- Deal with hecklers quickly and move on with your set. Humiliation tends to silence people in a crowd.
- If you donâ€™t have a quick response, just ask questions. Information is power. The more you have to work with, the better your chances are of giving them a quick verbal jab.
- Have a joke ready that can get huge laughs immediately in case a heckler says you're not funny.
- Try to be supportive and let them fail on their own. This keeps the audience on your side.
- Be ready to abandon your set if it gets really bad.

## Prepared Lines

- I don't know, people probably have some generic lines prepared for the most common outbursts. I don't have any at the moment.
