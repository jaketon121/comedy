# Organize Bits

This is how I sort my bits. I write them all out as if I'd never ehard them before and I need to tell them in the next five minutes (becasue sometimes that is actually how long I take to prepare a set). They also have names so that I can jot them down in a notebook and remember the material, not the arrangement.

- Segues
- Openers
- Polished
- TESTED/PRACTICE MORE
- GOOD ON FIRST ATTEMPT(S)
- UNTESTED/NEW MATERIAL
- UNDERDEVELOPED BITS (KEEP WRITING)
- Venues
- Bits by topic
- Long bits
- Bad jokes
