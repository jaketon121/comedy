# SETS AND DELIVERY

## Organizing a set

### Three Minute Sets

- Take your two longest bits and throw one out. Take the next longest bit and a few one liners. Now you have a three minute set.
- Take two or three short bits and a bunch of one liners. Arrange material that fits into one minute. Plan to do a bit and then some crowd work until the light comes on. Then do your last bit.

### Five Minute Sets

### Fifteen Minute Sets

- The fastest way to test material is to be a college student and sneak into open mics for musicians. No one is expecting comedy, so it's a tough crowd. People are really only there to see their friends perform (and none of your friends want to see you tell bad jokes, so you're probably alone). On top of that, you're almost guaranteed to offend someone, and when you're first starting out, you don't have control of the room, so one or two people can bring down the energy of the room. Just do it.

## Venues and Testing Jokes

- Do not yell into or drop the mirophone.
- Try different places. Multiple sets/week is ideal.
  - Dark, densely packed spaces with low ceilings are the easiest. If the audience doesn't laugh, it's your fault.
  - If the audience laughs in other places, repeat the bit everywhere you go because that bit has a lot of potential.
- If you want to build material, don’t repeat jokes, unless you’re on a writing spree anyway.
- You need to repeat jokes so that they’re polished, especially to get the club owner’s attention.
- Try sequencing your jokes in different ways (old-new-old, open with a closing bit, reorder jokes and rewrite segues) for better coverage.
- If it doesn't work at the popular places, (Comedy Store, Laugh Factory, Comedy Underground, etc.) it doesn't work.
- If it works in a well lit room with high ceilings or in broad daylight in front of a few sober people spaced far apart, it works everywhere.
- Your worst set/bit/performance should be about as good as your best.

## Bombing and Stage Fright

- I'm most nervous when I don't know what I'm going to say, so I honestly don't know what advice to offer anyone except to know your jokes and practice in the mirror.
- Bombing isn't as much fun, but I still enjoy myself because at least I went on. I don't like long periods without performing.
- If the audience is quiet, think of some comment to make about the crowd. Wait a few seconds and see how the crowd reacts.

## Arrogance

- Whenever you start to feel confident, open with a joke that falls flat.
- Build a set from your underdeveloped jokes just to see what it’s like to bomb.
- Perform in places other than comedy clubs.

## Presentation

- Don't dress like an asshole.
- Try not to take notes with you.
- Don't look down.
- Don't mess around with the mic stand.
- Clear the stage and don't lean on the mic stand.
- Speak slowly and clearly. Take time to look at each person in the crowd.
- Don't put down anyone, especially other comics.

## Audience

- Get the audience on your side
- You can start with dark humor to set the mood, but you have to build up to offensive material
- Don't get mad at the audience
- Don't make fun of your audience

## Timing

- Be one step ahead of the audience. There are some jokes where being one step behind the audience builds the right tension.
- Pause for laughter.
- Count the number of things you want the audience to pick up. That's more or less the number of seconds you should wait for everything to sink in. Don't talk until after that because you'll interrupt the audience's laughter.
- If you must laugh, wait until after the audience laughs. It’s contagious.

## After the Show

- Write down any changes in delivery and add them to your notes for that bit.
- Always talk to other comics...and notice when they just want to be left alone.
- Remember their names.
- Ask them about their jokes.
- As in life, don’t give unsolicited advice.
- Don’t talk about how you develop your jokes.
